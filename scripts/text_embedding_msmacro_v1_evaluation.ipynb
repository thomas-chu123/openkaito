This is because they give off carbon dioxide when burned thereby causing a greenhouse effect. This is also the main contributory factor to the global warming experienced by the earth today.', 'Benefits One of the biggest benefits of fossil fuels is their cost.

At the beginning of EDI (1970’s) there were no standards for the data format. When companies decided to establish EDI with a business partner, they agreed bilaterally which format to use. To reduce this complexity and the efforts, time and costs involved there where introduced the first standards in the 1980’s.', 'EDI can be transmitted using any methodology agreed to by the sender and recipient.

In the EDI world, these business documents are called transaction sets, and the customers and carriers with whom you do business are trading partners.

The government only has a right to limit those choices if the individual's actions endanger someone else. SUMMARY: We would have more money to spend on important problems if marijuana were legal. The third major reason that marijuana should be legal is because prohibition does not help the country in any way, and causes a lot of problems.\", \"Thus while marijuana-based medications should be available on a prescription basis from a pharmacy, pot use should not be normalized and the marijuana drug should be illegal.
